This program runs an AI for any Sudoku board input using C++. You can run the C++ project in the terminal by finding the Sudoku directory and typing: make solution
A preloaded board and solution will be printed in the terminal window. If you wish to enter your own board, go to the main function and follow the conventions listed for 
creating a cell and adding it to the board.

The UI is contained within the SSolver folder. Qt version 5.10.1 and qtcreator are required to run the user interface which allows user to input numbers into cells in a sudoku board and hit a solve button to see the solution.

The current executable is up in the Sudoku/build-SSolver-Desktop_Qt_5_11_0_clang_64bit-Debug/SSolver.app/Contents/MacOS directory so if Qt 5.10.1 is downloaded on your machine you could navigate to that directory and run ./SSolver

To build the project navigate to Sudoku/build-SSolver-Desktop_Qt_5_11_0_clang_64bit-Debug and run make. The newest executable will then be directory listed above.
