This program runs an AI for any Sudoku board input using C++. You can run the C++ project in the terminal by finding the Sudoku directory and typing: make solution
A preloaded board and solution will be printed in the terminal window. If you wish to enter your own board, go to the main function and follow the conventions listed for 
creating a cell and adding it to the board.

Eventually there will be an UI for users to enter values they want into the board and get a valid solution written in C# for windows.
